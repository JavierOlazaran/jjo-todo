**ABOUT MOODY'S ANALYTICS MACHINE LEARNING TEAM**

We are a team that creates and delivers machine learning models and applications for the financial services industry. At a high level, we ingest millions of news articles and other various data sources and process the data through pipelines to produce results such as entity recognition, sentiment analysis, credit adversity, and more.

As a full-stack engineer you will be responsible for creating and maintaining user experiences through web applications and API’s that interact with our growing data sources.

Interested in machine learning? Take advantage of our growing team's collective knowledge and learn as you go. We fully embrace cross-training and continuous learning.

### Objective

![design](https://dmxy96akqhjf3.cloudfront.net/assets/takehomes/fullstack-todo-app/desktop-preview.jpg)

Your challenge is to build out this full-stack todo app and 
get it looking as (reasonably) close to the design as possible.

### Brief

![stack](https://dmxy96akqhjf3.cloudfront.net/assets/takehomes/fullstack-todo-app/stack.png)

Implement your stack using the following technologies:

#### Client Side

* Angular 12.2
* Typescript
* Jest
* Cypress (Bonus)

#### Backend

* Nest.js
* Typescript
* Jest

> There is `style-guide.md`, which contains the information you'll need,
> such as color palette and fonts. Feel free to tweak to your content.

**Client Side**

Your users should be able to:

- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

As an engineer you should be able to:

- Maintain separation of concerns by using components, services, and helper classes.
- Use rxjs across the board (no promises). 
- Define all types using interfaces or classes (when appropriate). 
- Implement use cases for inheritance and polymorphism. 
- Greater than 90% test coverage using Jest. 
- Demonstrate the capabilities of one or more: pipes, directives, and interceptors.

🙋 If you're really feeling excited you should be able to: 

- 🎁 **Bonus**: Toggle light and dark mode
- 🎁 **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

**Server Side**

- Design a simple API for persisting state on the server side
- Implement routes for the following **CRUD** operations:
  - Create (POST for creating a new todo item)
  - Update (PUT for updating the todo item)
  - Delete (DELETE for deleting the todo item)
  - Patch (PATCH for updating a single field like `completed`)
- Implement JWT authentication (you can use a static key).
- Implement any other features you see fit.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   **Completeness**: did you complete the features?
-   **Correctness**: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   **Maintainability**: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   **Testing**: is the system adequately tested (unit, integration, e2e)?

### Submission

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into 
production - then push your changes to the master branch. 

After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy hacking! 💪💪
